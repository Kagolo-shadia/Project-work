            About Us
        </h4>
        <p>
            Founded in 2025 by the visionary Kagolo Shadia, our restaurant has deep roots in the traditions and tastes
            of Ugandan cuisine. What began as a humble kitchen serving neighbours and travellers has grown into a
            culinary haven that honours the essence of Uganda’s rich and diverse food culture. Shadia’s passion for
            bold, nourishing meals lives on in every dish we serve today.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We specialise in exotic Ugandan dishes that showcase a variety of flavours—from smoky grilled meats and
            creamy stews to delicately spiced vegetables and savoury banana-based staples. Every meal is a balance of
            tingling, tantalising tastes designed to awaken your senses and leave a lasting impression.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Our food is not just made to satisfy hunger, but to create joy, warmth, and connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            More than a restaurant, we are a legacy of flavour and hospitality passed down through generations. Step
            into our space and experience the comforting aroma of time-honoured recipes, the welcoming spirit of our
            team, and a celebration of Uganda’s culinary soul. We invite you to join us and enjoy a savoury journey that
            has been over a century in the making.
        </p>
